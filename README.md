To enable AI to understand movies, we conducted tests using BERT and EasyOCR. The objective of this test was to enable AI to differentiate between drama movies and tragedy movies.

# The Implementation results
Based on our test results, the objective of using BERT and EasyOCR for movie classification is to enable AI to differentiate between drama movies and tragedy movies. Through training and testing, our model has achieved good performance in this task. It can accurately classify movies based on factors such as plot, dialogue, and emotions, providing corresponding predictions. This allows AI to better understand and analyze movie content, providing users with more precise recommendations and suggestions. We will continue to optimize and improve this model to enhance its performance and accuracy.
